              "        'Image copyright Getty Images\\nOn Sunday morning, Donald Trump went off on a Twitter tirade against a member of his own party.\\nThis, in itself, isn\\'t exactly huge news. It\\'s far from the first time the president has turned his rhetorical cannons on his own ranks.\\nThis time, however, his attacks were particularly biting and personal. He essentially called Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, the chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a coward for not running for re-election.\\nHe said Mr Corker \"begged\" for the president\\'s endorsement, which he refused to give. He wrongly claimed that Mr Corker\\'s support of the Iranian nuclear agreement was his only political accomplishment.\\nUnlike some of his colleagues, Mr Corker - free from having to worry about his immediate political future - didn\\'t hold his tongue.\\nSkip Twitter post by @SenBobCorker It\\'s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning. — Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017 Report\\nThat wasn\\'t the end of it, though. He then spoke with the New York Times and really let the president have it. Here are four choice quotes from the Tennessee senator\\'s interview with the Times and why they are particularly damning.\\n\"I don\\'t know why the president tweets out things that are not true. You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.\"\\nYou can\\'t really sugarcoat this one. Mr Corker is flat-out saying the president is a liar - and everyone knows it.\\nThe senator, in particular, is challenging Mr Trump\\'s insistence that he unsuccessfully pleaded for his endorsement, but the accusation is much broader.\\nMr Corker and the president used to be something akin to allies. The Tennessean was on Mr Trump\\'s short list for vice-president and secretary of state.\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bob Corker at Trump campaign rally in July 2016\\nThose days are seemingly very much over now - and it\\'s not like Mr Corker is going anywhere anytime soon. Although he\\'s not running for re-election, he\\'ll be in the Senate, chairing a powerful committee, until January 2019.\\nThe president\\'s margin for success in that chamber is razor-thin. If Democrats can continue to stand together in opposition, he can afford to lose only two votes out of 52 Republican senators. That\\'s why healthcare reform collapsed in July - and it could be bad news for tax efforts.\\nFrom here on out, Mr Corker isn\\'t going to do the president any favours.\\n\"Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we\\'re dealing with here.\"\\nFrustration in Congress has been growing over what Republicans feel has been the president\\'s inability to focus on advancing their agenda. Getting a sharply divided party to come together on plans to repeal Obamacare, reform taxes or boost infrastructure spending is challenging enough. Doing so when the president stirs up unrelated controversies on a seemingly daily basis makes things all the harder.\\nOne of the president\\'s gifts has been his ability to shake off negative stories by quickly moving on to a different subject. That worked brilliantly during his presidential campaign, but it\\'s less effective during the legislative slow grind.\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Corker at the confirmation hearing for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\\nFor months, Republicans in Congress have been grumbling about this in the background and among themselves. Occasionally, someone like Mr McConnell will lament that the president doesn\\'t understand how the Senate works.\\nMr Corker has now stated it loud and clear. And, what\\'s more, he says almost everyone agrees with him. They\\'ve kept silent until now because they still hope to pass conservative legislation that the president can sign or fear Mr Trump\\'s legions will back a primary challenge next year or stay home during the general election.\\nIf that calculus ever changes - if it becomes riskier to stay silent than speak out - Mr Trump will be in real trouble.\\n\"A lot of people think that there is some kind of \\'good cop, bad cop\\' act underway, but that\\'s just not true.\"\\nTime and again, Mr Trump has appeared to undercut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others in his administration who are attempting to use soft diplomacy to deal with a range of international crises.\\nThe war against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran\\'s compliance with the multinational nuclear agreement, the ongoing dispute between Qatar and its Persian Gulf neighbours, the unrest in Venezuela and, most recently, North Korea\\'s continued ballistic missile tests have all been the target of the president\\'s offhand remarks and Twitter invective.\\nSome administration defenders have said this is all a part of Mr Trump\\'s strategy - an updated version of the Nixon-era \"madman theory\", in which the president forces adversaries to give way because they fear an unpredictable US leader\\'s actions.\\nMr Corker isn\\'t buying it. There\\'s no strategy, he says, just the possibility of chaos - which he hopes Mr Trump\\'s senior advisers will be able to avoid.\\n\"I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it\\'s a situation of trying to contain him.\"\\nThere\\'s now a growing collection of John Kelly face-palm photos that serve as a testament to the chief-of-staff\\'s reported frustration at dealing with the president.\\nMr Trump goes off-script to praise torch-bearing white nationalists at a rally in Charlottesville, and Mr Kelly is captured closing his eyes and rubbing the arch of his nose, as if attempting to stave off a migraine.\\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption White House Chief of Staff John Kelly looks on as US President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally\\nThe president calls North Korean leaders \"criminals\" in a speech to the United Nations, and Mr Kelly straight-up buries his face in his hands.\\nThe White House communications team is often left scrambling to try to explain or reframe an indelicate presidential \"joke\" or remark that directly contradicts what was until then the official administration line.\\nEven though Mr Kelly has brought some discipline to the West Wing staff, the president still marches to the beat of his own drum - and continues to have unfettered access to his phone\\'s Twitter app.\\nBob Corker is only the latest person - politician, journalist, sports star or celebrity - to feel the mercurial president\\'s uncontainable ire.'],\n",

              "        'LONDON (Reuters) - “Last Flag Flying”, a comedy-drama about Vietnam war veterans, will resonate with Trump’s America, despite, or perhaps because of, its period setting, actor Bryan Cranston said on Sunday after a screening at the London Film Festival.\\nSet in the United States in December 2003 – when U.S. forces in Iraq were dragging Saddam Hussein out of a “spider hole” - it is the story of three ageing former servicemen who reunite to bury the son of one of them who has been killed in action.\\nWith President Donald Trump saying he could “totally destroy” North Korea and characterizing a dinner with military commanders as “the calm before the storm”, Cranston said “Last Flag Flying” was a timely reminder of the effect on normal Americans of ill-advised military campaigns.\\n“I think it has a lot of relevance today in the sense that (today) it’s not clear cut as far as the (what are the) intentions of the government or military,” Cranston, acclaimed for his lead role in the TV drama “Breaking Bad”, told Reuters.\\n“In World War Two, it was the ‘good war’, it was clear and present danger, we had to stop this mad man. Since then, with Vietnam and Iraq, (there are) a lot of questions ... among the troops and the citizens as to if we are doing the right thing and what is the purpose of our being there.”\\nCast member Bryan Cranston (R) and director Richard Linklater pose with festival director Claire Stewart as they arrive for the premiere of \"Last Flag Flying\" during the British Film Institute (BFI) London Film Festival at the Odeon, Leicester Square, in London, Britain October 8, 2017.

Cranston plays a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking bar owner who is his own best customer, and Laurence Fishburne, is a man who has found God and become an evangelical preacher, preferring to forget the sex and drugs they all indulged in back in ‘Nam.\\nVanity Fair’s Richard Lawson said the film’s ability to honor the footsoldiers while being critical of the wars they are sent to fight, could hit “an Academy sweet spot, satisfying both the more conservative oldsters and the younger, leftier types.”\\nOther critics said “Last Flag Flying” lacked the light touch of Linklater’s best work. The Guardian’s Benjamin Lee called it “a half-baked TV movie masquerading as Oscarbait, a curious misstep for the Oscar-nominated indie auteur”.\\nWriting by Robin Pomeroy, editing by David Evans'],\n",

              "        \"The feud broke into public view last week when Mr. Corker said that Mr. Trump’s advisers were guarding against “chaos.” The president retaliated on Sunday by saying the retiring senator “didn’t have the guts to run” for another term. Mr. Corker responded on Twitter an hour later, saying that the White House had become an “adult day care center.”\\nHe then unloaded in an interview with The New York Times, saying in public what many of his Republican colleagues say in private — that the president is dangerously erratic, treats his high office like “a reality show,” has to be contained by his staff and is reckless enough to put the country “on the path to World War III.”\\nMr. Corker, a moderate by temperament as well as ideology, had measured his occasional criticisms of Mr. Trump for months in hopes of influencing his foreign policy, but evidently feels liberated now that he has decided not to run for a third term.\\nFew other incumbent Republicans rushed to the microphones to echo his comments on Monday, but several made little attempt to hide their irritation at Mr. Trump for attacking Mr. Corker.\\n“He’s an important part of our team, and he’s a particularly important part of the budget debate, which will be on the floor next week,” Mr. McConnell said pointedly at an event in Hazard, Ky., with Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n“Bob Corker has been a leader in Congress on issues as diverse as deficit reduction and combating terrorism, and he is a man of unwavering integrity,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said in a statement. “If we’re going to accomplish our economic and national security agenda we’re going to have to work together, period.”\\nMr. McConnell’s associates were blunter in expressing the leadership’s frustration with the president for disrupting party unity as Republicans push for tax cuts. “This was going to be hard no matter what,” said Billy Piper, Mr. McConnell’s former chief of staff. “And he took the guy who was one of the linchpins of this and incinerated him for no reason.”\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nThe White House spent Monday telling allies that Mr. Corker was responsible for the fight, not Mr. Trump, and that the senator was an attention-seeking obstructionist.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It adds to their ability and their cover to speak about the president of the United States in ways that no president should be talked about.”\\nVice President Mike Pence was left to defend Mr. Trump against what he called “empty rhetoric and baseless attacks,” saying the president had accomplished a lot internationally. “Today our nation once again stands without apology as leader of the free world,” Mr. Pence said in a statement. “That’s what American leadership on the world stage looks like and no amount of criticism at home can diminish those results.”\\nMr. Trump has grown frustrated by Senate Republicans — including lashing out at Mr. McConnell for not getting the job done — as legislation to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care program has been repeatedly blocked. He has engaged in open conflicts with Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, among others, although just Monday he went golfing with Mr. Graham.\\nSome Republican senators share Mr. Trump’s frustration with gridlock in the Senate. “We want things to move quickly,” said Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who was elected in 2014. “People are frustrated with the lack of results.”\\nSenator David Perdue of Georgia, another member of the 2014 class, has been even more outspoken in venting about fellow Republicans derailing health care legislation. “People are very upset that Republican senators are not backing the agenda of this president,” he said.\\nMr. Trump’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, acting in what he says is the president’s interest, is organizing a rebellion against the Republican establishment and recruiting candidates to challenge incumbent senators in primaries next year. “This is what they think about President Trump behind closed doors,” Mr. Bannon said on Fox News on Monday night, referring to Mr. Corker’s comments and calling on the senator to resign. Mr. Pence’s chief of staff has talked about a “purge” of Republicans who are not loyal to Mr. Trump.\\nThat may keep more Republicans on board even if they agree with Mr. Corker.\\n“Do most senators have their doubts about the president?” asked John Feehery, a longtime Republican congressional aide. “That’s probably true, but also largely irrelevant. He’s the president, and they have to find ways to get stuff done with him. Otherwise, they face the wrath of the voters — something Bob Corker no longer worries about.”\\nIn effect, Mr. McCain, Ms. Murkowski and Senator Susan Collins of Maine already were free agents on many issues. Regular defections by Mr. Corker would make the president’s ability to pass legislation that much harder, absent bipartisan deals with Democrats.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nAs chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Corker could block the confirmation of a new secretary of state should Mr. Trump push out his embattled chief diplomat, Rex W. Tillerson. He also, presumably, would play a key role in any decision on whether to tear up the Iran nuclear deal.\\n“Senate Republicans’ frustrations with Trump are starting to boil over,” said Alex Conant, a former Senate Republican aide. “I’m sure the feelings are mutual inside the White House. The relationship was always tenuous at best, but Corker’s comments are a new low point.”\\n“If they were getting a lot done, it would be easier for everyone to get along,” Mr. Conant said. “Of course, the fact that they’re not getting along also makes it harder to get anything done.”\"],\n",

This is love. That all encompassing, enduring, accepting, near perfect love. The kind that trumps my need to snap back at people who have the audacity to comment on my Instagram about whether I loved my first husband or not. But let me take a moment to explain something to you. There is no timeline for grief or for when God moves in your life in undeniable ways. There are a lot of people who think it isn\\'t good to be transparent on social media but I say forget that. I\\'m going to be open and honest because God wants me to. It\\'s part of my testimony and it needs to be said. I was a mess yesterday during our wedding ceremony. So many emotions flooded my heart as I walked down those balcony steps to the arms of my gift from God. I thought of Chris watching us and knowing he would have loved the choice I made, for me and for the boys. I thought of Chris\\'s amazing parents sitting front row and how much of a blessing they have been and will forever be in our lives. How happy they are for the boys and I and how much they already love Josiah. I am so completely humbled by the love I receive from this man. Jo came along EXACTLY when God knew I needed him. It wasn\\'t my choice to fall in love so quickly after chris passed but I was growing so comfortable with being alone that it was becoming unhealthy. Looking back now I think God saw that if I went too long without love that it would become increasingly difficult for me to submit to the authority of a husband after being set in my own ways. When I say \"Jo is the greatest thing that\\'s ever happened to me\" that in no way indicates that I didn\\'t love my first husband with all that I had. How dare any one of you judge me and say that on a social platform. It doesn\\'t make you any better of a person to cast judgment on others and sit in the seat of mockers. I will always love chris and jo knows that. And I will always love Jo. The beautiful thing about love is that it multiplies as new blessings come into your life. I don\\'t have to share one bucket of love with the special people in my life. Each one has their own bucket. Get it? Isn\\'t that amazing?? God\\'s timing is not our own. And I praise Him for that. You should too. A post shared by Tiffany Thornton (@tiffthornton) on Oct 8, 2017 at 6:49am PDT\\nShe went on to say \"There is no timeline for grief or for when God moves in your life in undeniable ways\" and said she was extremely emotional walking down the aisle.\\n\"I thought of Chris watching us and knowing he would have loved the choice I made, for me and for the boys,\" she wrote.\" I thought of Chris\\'s amazing parents sitting front row and how much of a blessing they have been and will forever be in our lives.\"\\n\"It wasn\\'t my choice to fall in love so quickly after Chris passed but I was growing so comfortable with being alone that it was becoming unhealthy,\" she continued. \"Looking back now I think God saw that if I went too long without love that it would become increasingly difficult for me to submit to the authority of a husband after being set in my own ways.\"\\nThornton called Capaci the \"greatest thing that\\'s ever happened to me\" and said her new marriage \"in no way indicates that I didn\\'t love my first husband with all that I had.\"\\n\"It doesn\\'t make you any better of a person to cast judgment on others and sit in the seat of mockers,\" she said. \"I will always love Chris and Jo knows that.

              "        \"The Yankees will start C. C. Sabathia against Corey Kluber, the Indians’ ace, for the opportunity to face Houston in the American League Championship Series.\\nThe Yankees — with an assist from Urshela — pounced early on Trevor Bauer, who had shut them out for seven innings in the series opener. They rode the electric right arm of starter Luis Severino, who delivered a redemptive performance after being knocked out early in a wild-card victory over the Minnesota Twins.\\nSeverino, with his team facing elimination and its bullpen running on fumes, relied heavily on his 100-mile-per-hour fastball over seven strong innings. He allowed four hits — including a two-run homer to Carlos Santana and a solo shot to Roberto Perez — while striking out nine.\\nWhen Michael Brantley singled with one out in the seventh and the Yankees already staked to a 7-3 lead, Manager Joe Girardi appeared headed to the mound. But the pitching coach Larry Rothschild got his attention, and Girardi returned to his perch on the top railing of the dugout.\\nPhoto\\nSeverino proceeded to strike out Lonnie Chisenhall for a third time and then, with another full-throated crowd chanting his name, he retired Perez on a grounder to shortstop.\\nHis final pitch, No. 113 — the most he had thrown since July — ended the threat, but it did not stop the crowd, which sang “Sev-er-in-o” throughout the break between half-innings.\\n“I hear the stadium calling my name, so I know I’ve got to go over there and finish the inning,” Severino said.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nImmediately after his departure, the tenuous state of the Yankees’ bullpen was exposed. Dellin Betances, who had seemed to straighten out his control problems, walked the first two hitters — including two pitches that sailed to the backstop. But Tommy Kahnle entered after the two walks and retired the heart of the Indians order — striking out Jason Kipnis, getting out Jose Ramirez on a fly ball and fanning Jay Bruce before letting out a roar.\\nKahnle closed out the ninth by striking out the side.\\nIf the Yankees seemed to ride the momentum of Sunday night’s 1-0 victory, also an elimination game, the Indians appeared to be playing with a degree of anxiety on Monday — even if Francona insisted beforehand that they would not.\\n“If one game changes our confidence level, we weren’t as good as I thought we were, so I would say no,” Francona said before the game. “Our guys will be fine.”\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After Bauer struck out Chase Headley in the second inning, he gave up four consecutive hits — one more than the total he allowed in the series opener.\\nBauer had carved up the Yankees in the series opener, no-hitting them for five and two-thirds innings. Before that game, and earlier on Monday, Girardi said the Yankees would look for an opportunity to get inside the head of Bauer, whose unconventional training regimen and quirky personality have not always endeared him to coaches and teammates. This drew a laugh from Indians center fielder Jason Kipnis.\\n“I think he’s got enough of his own self in there,” Kipnis said. “There’s no room for other people’s thoughts in there.”\\nPhoto\\nKipnis warned that Bauer’s unshakable belief in himself — and in his methods — was a big reason he won a career-high 17 games this season and dominated Game 1, the third time he had beaten the Yankees this season.\\n“Don’t underestimate or don’t take his quirkiness or mannerisms for vulnerability,” Kipnis said. “He’s set in his ways and he’s gaining confidence this year with the way he’s been pitching.”\\nIf the Yankees did not take up residence inside Bauer’s head, they put on a master class in reading his mind. Todd Frazier, in reaching over the plate and hooking a 3-1 curveball into the left-field corner that hit the foul line to score Castro for a 1-0 lead, took the type of swing a batter takes when he knows which pitch is coming.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nAnd why wouldn’t he? It was the fourth curveball Bauer had thrown him in the five-pitch at-bat.\\n“If he throws a fastball, maybe I’m late and hit it to right, maybe I miss it,” said Frazier, who noted that Bauer tends to throw more breaking pitches with runners in scoring position. “It’s one of those things where I wasn’t guessing, but I was slowing my body down to where I was ready for it.”\\nLater that inning, Aaron Judge delivered a two-out, two-run double on a 3-2 pitch — a tailing, letter-high 99-mile-per-hour fastball — to stake the Yankees to a 4-0 lead. It is a pitch Judge has rarely handled this season, but it was also the same one Bauer threw past him in a full count on his first trip to the plate.\\n“Before I step in the box, I try to have a solid plan,” Judge said. “My plan was to stay on the heater, especially a guy like Bauer who has good stuff and has confidence. He’s going to come after you.”\\nThat was Judge’s only hit of the series and his only contact of the night. He struck out four times and is now 1 for 15 with 12 strikeouts.\\nBut as bad as Judge has been at the plate this series, the Indians were worse in the field on Monday. Urshela’s high throw with two out and the bases loaded in the third pulled Santana off first base, allowing Castro to score and push the Yankees’ lead to 5-0.\\nAfter the homers by Santana in the fourth and by Perez in the fifth brought the Indians to within 5-3, the Indians were betrayed by their defense again. Reliever Danny Salazar fielded Frazier’s tapper but bounced his throw badly past Santana for a two-base error. Frazier would score when Kipnis — recently moved from second base to center field — couldn’t throw him out on Brett Gardner’s shallow fly ball.\\n“He hasn’t played there a lot so why not take the chance?” Frazier said.\\nGary Sanchez pushed the lead to 7-3 in the sixth with a home run to right field off reliever Bryan Shaw. It was the only earned run the Yankees pushed across all night, but by then the Yankees had all the help they would need.\"]],\n",

              "       'Image copyright Getty Images\\nOn Sunday morning, Donald Trump went off on a Twitter tirade against a member of his own party.\\nThis, in itself, isn\\'t exactly huge news. It\\'s far from the first time the president has turned his rhetorical cannons on his own ranks.\\nThis time, however, his attacks were particularly biting and personal. He essentially called Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, the chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a coward for not running for re-election.\\nHe said Mr Corker \"begged\" for the president\\'s endorsement, which he refused to give. He wrongly claimed that Mr Corker\\'s support of the Iranian nuclear agreement was his only political accomplishment.\\nUnlike some of his colleagues, Mr Corker - free from having to worry about his immediate political future - didn\\'t hold his tongue.\\nSkip Twitter post by @SenBobCorker It\\'s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning. — Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017 Report\\nThat wasn\\'t the end of it, though. He then spoke with the New York Times and really let the president have it. Here are four choice quotes from the Tennessee senator\\'s interview with the Times and why they are particularly damning.\\n\"I don\\'t know why the president tweets out things that are not true. You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.\"\\nYou can\\'t really sugarcoat this one. Mr Corker is flat-out saying the president is a liar - and everyone knows it.\\nThe senator, in particular, is challenging Mr Trump\\'s insistence that he unsuccessfully pleaded for his endorsement, but the accusation is much broader.\\nMr Corker and the president used to be something akin to allies. The Tennessean was on Mr Trump\\'s short list for vice-president and secretary of state.\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Bob Corker at Trump campaign rally in July 2016\\nThose days are seemingly very much over now - and it\\'s not like Mr Corker is going anywhere anytime soon. Although he\\'s not running for re-election, he\\'ll be in the Senate, chairing a powerful committee, until January 2019.\\nThe president\\'s margin for success in that chamber is razor-thin. If Democrats can continue to stand together in opposition, he can afford to lose only two votes out of 52 Republican senators. That\\'s why healthcare reform collapsed in July - and it could be bad news for tax efforts.\\nFrom here on out, Mr Corker isn\\'t going to do the president any favours.\\n\"Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we\\'re dealing with here.\"\\nFrustration in Congress has been growing over what Republicans feel has been the president\\'s inability to focus on advancing their agenda. Getting a sharply divided party to come together on plans to repeal Obamacare, reform taxes or boost infrastructure spending is challenging enough. Doing so when the president stirs up unrelated controversies on a seemingly daily basis makes things all the harder.\\nOne of the president\\'s gifts has been his ability to shake off negative stories by quickly moving on to a different subject. That worked brilliantly during his presidential campaign, but it\\'s less effective during the legislative slow grind.\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Corker at the confirmation hearing for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\\nFor months, Republicans in Congress have been grumbling about this in the background and among themselves. Occasionally, someone like Mr McConnell will lament that the president doesn\\'t understand how the Senate works.\\nMr Corker has now stated it loud and clear. And, what\\'s more, he says almost everyone agrees with him. They\\'ve kept silent until now because they still hope to pass conservative legislation that the president can sign or fear Mr Trump\\'s legions will back a primary challenge next year or stay home during the general election.\\nIf that calculus ever changes - if it becomes riskier to stay silent than speak out - Mr Trump will be in real trouble.\\n\"A lot of people think that there is some kind of \\'good cop, bad cop\\' act underway, but that\\'s just not true.\"\\nTime and again, Mr Trump has appeared to undercut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others in his administration who are attempting to use soft diplomacy to deal with a range of international crises.\\nThe war against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran\\'s compliance with the multinational nuclear agreement, the ongoing dispute between Qatar and its Persian Gulf neighbours, the unrest in Venezuela and, most recently, North Korea\\'s continued ballistic missile tests have all been the target of the president\\'s offhand remarks and Twitter invective.\\nSome administration defenders have said this is all a part of Mr Trump\\'s strategy - an updated version of the Nixon-era \"madman theory\", in which the president forces adversaries to give way because they fear an unpredictable US leader\\'s actions.\\nMr Corker isn\\'t buying it. There\\'s no strategy, he says, just the possibility of chaos - which he hopes Mr Trump\\'s senior advisers will be able to avoid.\\n\"I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it\\'s a situation of trying to contain him.\"\\nThere\\'s now a growing collection of John Kelly face-palm photos that serve as a testament to the chief-of-staff\\'s reported frustration at dealing with the president.\\nMr Trump goes off-script to praise torch-bearing white nationalists at a rally in Charlottesville, and Mr Kelly is captured closing his eyes and rubbing the arch of his nose, as if attempting to stave off a migraine.\\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption White House Chief of Staff John Kelly looks on as US President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally\\nThe president calls North Korean leaders \"criminals\" in a speech to the United Nations, and Mr Kelly straight-up buries his face in his hands.\\nThe White House communications team is often left scrambling to try to explain or reframe an indelicate presidential \"joke\" or remark that directly contradicts what was until then the official administration line.\\nEven though Mr Kelly has brought some discipline to the West Wing staff, the president still marches to the beat of his own drum - and continues to have unfettered access to his phone\\'s Twitter app.\\nBob Corker is only the latest person - politician, journalist, sports star or celebrity - to feel the mercurial president\\'s uncontainable ire.'],\n",
